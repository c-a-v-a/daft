Markdown table of contents generator written in rust.

# writing TOC to a file
daft can write TOC to a file, putting in on <!-- TOC --> comment.

## possible improvements
1. ordered table of contents
2. custom styling (heading level of TOC, what positions are ordered and unordered)
3. Fix for using **#** inside of heading (for now it becomes invisible).
